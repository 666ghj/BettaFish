 ### **[Important Announcement] Refactoring Plan for Weibo_PublicOpinion_AnalysisSystem**

Dear all contributors, users, and followers,

Hello everyone,

I am the initiator and main developer of this project. First and foremost, I want to personally thank you for your continued attention, contributions, and enthusiasm for the `Weibo_PublicOpinion_AnalysisSystem` project.

Over the past period, as the project has expanded, I have noticed several challenges that require attention:

1. **Architectural and Module Issues:** Through rapid iteration, many modules have been integrated. However, a lack of unified top-level design has led to some module conflicts and a need for structural optimization.
2. **High Barrier to Entry:** A significant current challenge is that users need to configure their own crawlers and scrape data from scratch. This makes the deployment and startup process relatively complex, creating an inconvenience for many new users.
3. **Development and Presentation Limitations:** The development progress of various functional modules has been uneven. Additionally, the existing dashboard paradigm has limitations in compatibility and scalability that hinder my future development goals.
4. **Constraints of the Self-Trained Model:** Considering its size and maintenance costs, the previously trained model has become a constraint on the project's long-term development.

After a careful evaluation of these points, and in light of current technological trends (especially in LLMs, and Agents), I have decided to initiate a **comprehensive, bottom-up architectural refactoring** of the project, with the goal of providing a more user-friendly tool for everyone.

**My next update plan will focus on:**

1. **Optimizing the Core Architecture:** I will be moving away from the current dashboard-centric presentation to design a more lightweight and flexible system framework.
2. **Focusing on Core Competencies:** The new architecture will refocus my efforts on the crawling, processing, and in-depth analysis of Weibo data, aiming to build a stable and efficient data core.
3. **Integrating Advanced Large Language Models (LLMs):** I plan to discontinue maintenance of the self-trained model and will instead utilize APIs to call mainstream large language models for analysis tasks, enhancing the system's analytical capabilities and flexibility.
4. **The Ultimate Goal: A New Model of "Deployable Core + Online Service":**
   - **For Developers:** I aim to refine the project into a **"minimal, user-friendly, low-cost, modular"** public opinion analysis **core engine** to facilitate secondary development and private deployment.
   - **For General Users:** Leveraging the new architecture, I **plan to introduce a new "Online Service" version, designed to address the challenges of deployment and data acquisition.**
     - **Providing a Shared Database:** I will begin building and maintaining a **continuously updated, shared database**. This will allow users to access our data source directly, **removing the need to configure and run their own crawlers.**
     - **Simplifying the User Experience:** This will eliminate the need for a complex local setup, enabling a **click-to-use** experience.
     - **Retaining Personalized Analysis:** Users will still be able to configure their own LLM API keys in the online service to perform personalized, in-depth analysis with our data core.

This refactoring is a necessary step in our development. I understand this will require adjusting and, in some cases, rewriting code to which many of you have contributed. However, for the long-term health of the project and to make it accessible to a broader audience, I believe this step is essential.

In the coming weeks, I will begin to outline the new project blueprint and will keep the community updated on my progress. I value your wisdom and support now more than ever.

Thank you once again for your understanding and support! Let's look forward to the next evolution of `Weibo_PublicOpinion_AnalysisSystem`.

Sincerely,

Project Initiator
