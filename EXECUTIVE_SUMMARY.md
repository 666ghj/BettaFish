# BettaFish USA - Executive Summary

**Project:** Transform Chinese social media analyzer to USA market intelligence platform
**Timeline:** 20 weeks (5 months) | **Investment:** $130K - $476K | **Team:** 4-6 people

---

## The Opportunity

BettaFish is a sophisticated multi-agent AI system that analyzes millions of social media posts to provide sentiment insights. Currently optimized for Chinese platforms (Weibo, Douyin, Xiaohongshu), we will adapt it for the USA market (Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn).

**Market Gap:** Most sentiment analysis tools are expensive ($50K+/year) and closed-source. BettaFish USA will be the leading open-source alternative.

## What Makes It Amazing

🤖 **Multi-Agent AI Architecture** - Four specialized AI agents collaborate in a "forum" to synthesize insights

📊 **Cross-Platform Intelligence** - Unified analysis across Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn

⚡ **Real-Time Analysis** - Process 10,000+ posts/hour with sub-5-minute query response

🎯 **85%+ Accuracy** - Sentiment analysis fine-tuned for USA cultural context

📈 **Predictive Analytics** - Forecast sentiment trends 7-14 days ahead

💰 **Cost Effective** - 50-70% cheaper than enterprise alternatives (Brandwatch, Sprinklr)

🔓 **Open Source** - Full transparency, customizable, research-grade methodology
