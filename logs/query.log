[17:27:20] Warning: the config option 'server.enableCORS=false' is not compatible with
[17:27:20] 'server.enableXsrfProtection=true'.
[17:27:20] As a result, 'server.enableCORS' is being overridden to 'true'.
[17:27:20] More information:
[17:27:20] In order to protect against CSRF attacks, we send a cookie with each request.
[17:27:20] To do so, we must specify allowable origins, which places a restriction on
[17:27:20] cross-origin resource sharing.
[17:27:20] If cross origin resource sharing is required, please disable server.enableXsrfProtection.
