[19:38:31] Warning: the config option 'server.enableCORS=false' is not compatible with
[19:38:31] 'server.enableXsrfProtection=true'.
[19:38:31] As a result, 'server.enableCORS' is being overridden to 'true'.
[19:38:31] More information:
[19:38:31] In order to protect against CSRF attacks, we send a cookie with each request.
[19:38:31] To do so, we must specify allowable origins, which places a restriction on
[19:38:31] cross-origin resource sharing.
[19:38:31] If cross origin resource sharing is required, please disable server.enableXsrfProtection.
[19:38:32] 2025-08-26 19:38:32.008 Port 8503 is already in use
